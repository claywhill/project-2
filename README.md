## Description: 
"Try Before You Die!!!" app allows you to create and manage a list of things you would like to do before you die, a bucket list. Recent events in life have changed everything so now is the best time to start listing out what you would like ot get out of life before you are unable to. Create an item, assign a category, set a realistic time frame to complete the item and mark as complete when accomplished. If the item is no longer relevant you can either edit the item or deleted it altogether. 

To assist you in making this item come true we have provided some helpful links to get you started. Most of the high priority items fall under "Travel" and "Dating", there will be more to come in the next release so we look forward to your feedback. 


## Getting Started:
1. Under the "Create a new bucket list item" enter in the following
  *"Enter a todo" = Name of the task*
  *"Enter a category" = categorize the list item such as: "Hobby", "Travel", "Family Event". Have fun making your own unique categories related to you.*
  *"Enter End Date" = use the following formate "mm/dd/year" that you would like to complete the task by.*
2. Click the Create Button. 
*Your item will now display as the last item on the list.*

**Use the check box to mark the item as complete as you go along.

**Use the edit button to modify the "title", "category" or "due date"

**Use the delete button to remove the list item entirely.

As mentioned in the description, to assist making each item more of a reality we have included a few helpful buttons to get you going. Currently "Travel" and "Dating" are avaiable.
